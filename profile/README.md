## CodeHive

Before getting into the org description, we had another org - https://github.com/Traverse2023. However, we overextended the necessary resources for an mvp. With this new org, we are planning to implement the project with a limited number of services, so we can fully focus on the ux. 
So, with that being said, CodeHive is a platform for all coding enthusiasts and members, or Bees, will be able to message, voice & video chat, send snippets of code, share screen, and more to communicate. 
You can also start coding seshions where you can compete against other bees with algorithmic-style progamming questions. We also want to be able to add a collaborative mode, so you can work together with others. 
You can also find others who are looking to collaborate on projects, hackathons, job postings, and more! If you are a CS student, this has to be the place to be to talk, live, and breath code.
